# InventoryDB

I created InventoryDB to create a list of all my dvds, audiobooks and books of mine. To add new items to the DB
you can add items by there EAN Number or ISBN. A description and a image of the item is then extraced via webscraping from
various webpages.

## Requirements

You need a working Python3 installation with flask.

## Installation

You can run the web app via the following command:

    python3 web/webgui.py
    
from this folder.
